# os-comp-challenge-1

## About
This project is inspired by my friends' dad who was a comic artist in his 20's, and is currently documenting images of people and places in his travels. It is meant to be pushed live and showcase his work as his journal, and also as a surprise Christmas present to him.

## Resources
Most images were sent to me by both of his daughters. I utilized icon images that was available for free download on the internet.

## Specs
The site composition should be responsive to most popular mobile device- Samsung Galaxy series and iPhone 5-8
